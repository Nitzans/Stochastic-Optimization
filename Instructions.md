# Stochastic-Optimization
Mini project in Stochastic Optimization: Homologous finding

BACKGROUND:

HP-proteins are abstract type of 2D proteins which consist only two types: H (Hidrophobic amino acid) and P (Polar amino acid).
Our goal was to find pairs of such proteins which has the same structure but different sequence (i.e. homologous).

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Run the "Main.java" class with 3 arguments: 
1. Sequence length.
2. Number of identical structures (the lowest the better).
3. Maximum frequency of "H" characters, a number between 0 to 1 (the ideal is 0.5).

The output file contains all the homologous pairs with the obtains structure.

The homologous interface can be implemented in various ways, as you choose.
